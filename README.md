# Welcome to the _unofficial_ PTA Companion app

The game itself uses a lot of super-crunchy mechanics, and is very heavily stat-based. This means:
* Lots of headaches working out numbers
* Lots of mental arithmetic to do - lots of the time
* Lots of things that can get slightly wrong and not be noticed

But what it really boils down to is *the game gets a little too clunky* for its own good.

# Our mission

We love playing the game - it's a great adaptation, and it enables all kinds of fun stories _(I'll go into some of ours with an anecdotes section in the app another time!)_
So we're making the game digital. Putting stats, moves, and references in one easy-to-use place, and making it possible for players to create their teams, and level them up, with a fluid interface that doesn't slow down game-time.

### This is a work in progress - please be kind!
